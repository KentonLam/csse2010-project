# CSSE2010 Project
Asteroids clone for CSSE2010. Written in C for the ATmega324A. Course taken at UQ in semester 1, 2019.

<aside class="notice">

> :information_source: **Note:** Much of the code here was written by Peter Sutton, the course coordinator. 
The [initial commit](https://github.com/KentonLam/csse2010-project/commit/0436f0e4917e9887af986815c2863695dbded193) contains only very small 
edits from the provided code.

> :warning: **Disclaimer:** In places, this project does not follow coding best-practices due to time constraints and prioritisation of features. 
This is mostly evident in the code structure and global state interactions.
